# LargeGPT Project - An AI-Powered Chatbot

Welcome to the LargeGPT project! This project is an AI-powered chatbot built from scratch by DrDataYE, without utilizing any external API services.

## Installation

To use LargeGPT on your system, follow these steps:

1. Set up a virtual environment using your preferred environment manager (e.g., `virtualenv` or `conda`).
2. Activate the new environment.
3. Install dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can easily run LargeGPT. Open the `main.py` file and execute the main script. The chatbot will respond to the text you input via the command-line interface.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Training (Optional)

If you're interested in training your own GPT model, you can follow these steps:

1. Access the OpenAI website and obtain access to their API.
2. Modify the `train.py` file to suit your training needs and strategies.
3. Run the program to start the training process:

python train.py
```
